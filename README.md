# Mibbler

## Introduction
Mibbler is a utility for generating Java representations of entities described in SNMP MIB files.  

At a high level it parses a set of SNMP MIBs and in conjunction with some supplied metadata generates a Jar file 
that provides JavaBeans and Helper classes for interacting with SNMP Devices that conform to the MIB definitions supplied.

To leverage the Java Classes generated by Mibbler an additional jar file is required containing common SNMP code, further information
on this jar can be found at [snmp-core](https://github.com/btisystems/snmp-core).

## License
The utility itself uses the brilliant SNMP Mib Parser, [Mibble](https://github.com/cederberg/mibble) contributed by Per Cederberg.
 This parsing library is GPL code and as such the Mibbler generator code is provided following the GPL License model.
 
 
The output generated by the utility has no dependency on Mibble and as such is Licensed separately following the Apache License, Version 2.0.
